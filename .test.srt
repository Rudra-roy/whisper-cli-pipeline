00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,119
This video includes a discussion of serious crimes, which may be disturbing for some viewers,

2
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:13,640
so I wanted to let you know that up front.

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,320
But I think it's necessary to talk about these crimes in some detail for reasons that

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,239
will become apparent.

5
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:27,879
In the small town of Visalia, California, in the mid-1970s, one of the state's most prolific

6
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:30,000
criminals got his start.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,479
He repeatedly broke into houses and stole small items, like cash, coins, and jewelry.

8
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:42,399
He was dubbed the Visalia Ransacker, but soon his crimes escalated.

9
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,119
Six months later, 1976, he moves up to to Sacramento and over the course of the next three years

10
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:54,960
is moving all across northern California committing numerous sexual assaults over 50 sexual assaults.

11
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,320
Here he was called the East Area rapist. The police are saying lock up tight.

12
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,280
Sacramento's infamous East Area rapists may still be in town.

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,239
And then in 1979, he moves down to Southern California starting in Santa Barbara and starts

14
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,239
killing.

15
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,959
And he was known as the original night stalker in Southern California.

16
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:21,159
Variously known as the East Area rapist and the original night stalker, these were brutal,

17
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:25,219
meticulously planned crimes that spanned numerous California counties

18
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:28,680
between 1976 and 1986.

19
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,359
Police believed that all of these crimes were committed

20
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:35,799
by the same person, now known as the Golden State Killer.

21
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:38,959
How was it known that these were committed by the same person?

22
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,239
Investigators were relying on MMO.

23
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:48,480
MMO, MODIS operandi, is basically how a criminal will commit a crime.

24
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,480
I was wearing some type of...

25
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,159
I'm a master who had wearing shorts in a t-shirt. The Golden Snake Killer had very distinct

26
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,560
of them up. What he would do is he would wake into a house with a gun, a house with a man and

27
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,879
a woman, he would tie them up, tell the man I'm going to put plates on your back.

28
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,039
If I hear those plates move, I'm going to kill your wife and then kill you, take the

29
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,560
life into another room and sexually assault her.

30
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,599
Then he would go through the house for, however much time eating, stealing stuff, stealing

31
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,000
little things or whatever, and then he would leave.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,599
How is he not caught based on fingerprint evidence?

33
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,599
Well, he deleted fingerprints.

34
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,599
He always wore masks.

35
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,599
He always had gloves off.

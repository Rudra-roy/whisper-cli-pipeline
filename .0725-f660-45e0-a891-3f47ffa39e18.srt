We're not sure right now how much we got left in the tank for additional dirt.

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,000
We have another truck on standby

I see from EMS 2 on one

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I see

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Repeat your message

00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yeah, this is EMS 2. I took over staging

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What you have is rescue 3 and a vacuum truck in Staging.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:56,000
See you back on Steam. We also going to have engine 29 and truck 94 responding as well. They should meet up with you in Staging.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Roger is at 29 and did you say truck 94 or into 94? So be truck 94, engine 29, just let me know when they get on safe.

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,760
Roger.
